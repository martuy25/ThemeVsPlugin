# ThemeVsPlugin
- Python script that allows users to search for vulnerabilities in WordPress plugins and themes. By providing the name of a plugin or theme as input, the script fetches data from the Wordfence website, parses the HTML content, and extracts information about any vulnerabilities found. It displays the total number of vulnerabilities, along with details such as the name, number of vulnerabilities, last vulnerability date, and vulnerability link for each plugin or theme
